# ES6 module boilerplate with full ES6 test suits and coverage

Inspired from https://istanbul.js.org/docs/tutorials/es2015/ and https://github.com/bcoe/es2015-coverage. 
Added : rollup bundling and karma runner + clean and complete.

- ES6 sources
- transpiled with [babel](https://babeljs.io) (to dist/es5/*)
- bundled with [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) (to dist/bundles/*)
- ES6 tests with [mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [chai](http://chaijs.com/) (runned directly from es6 with [babel-register](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babel-register/))
- [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) runner with on-the-fly rollup/babel bundling
- Code coverage with [istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) and [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) directly from ES6 tests and sources (no bundle)
- [coveralls](https://coveralls.io) reporting
- [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for semver management and Changelog.md generation.
- [travis.ci](https://travis-ci.org/) config file
- [esdoc](https://esdoc.org) config file
- [eslint](http://eslint.org) ES6 base config for src and test

## Usage

clone this repo then :

```
> npm i
```

then :

- build : `> npm run build`
- test :  `> mocha` or `> npm test`
- karma : `> npm run karma`
- cover : `> npm run cover`
- es5-watch : `> npm run es5-watch`
- bundles-watch : `> npm run bundles-watch`


## Produced outputs

- dist/es5/* : commonjs unbundled files (transpiled with babel)
- dist/bundles/index.js : cjs module
- dist/bundles/index.min.js : cjs module minified with uglifyjs
- dist/bundles/index.mjs : ES module

## For coveralls 

Travis is configured to run coveralls by default.

So either you remove coveralls run in travis config file, or add a .coveralls.yml with your "repo_token: ......" before pushing to travis (after a first manual npm run coveralls).
